# tfy4125
Script for a lab report in the course TFY4125 - Fysikk at NTNU
The script allows for calculation of acceleration, velocity and normal force of a small, solid ball at a recorded track. 

The methods for reading values as well as the trvalues.py file were given. Euler's method as well as the plotting was implemented as part of the tasks to be done.
